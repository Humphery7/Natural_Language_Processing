## Natural_Language_Processing

This Repository contains projects done on the **Deep learning specialization(NLP) by Andrew Ng ** on cousera, projects range from : <br />

### WEEK 1
-> Bulding a RNN and LSTM from scratch, <br /> 
-> Buliding a character level text-generation Language model, <br />
-> Generating Music Using an LSTM model, <br />

### WEEK 2
-> Using Word Embeddings, loading/modifying pre-trained word embeddings, measuring similarity between texts, Debiasing <br />
-> Using word vector representations to build two Emojifiers: the first will be a baseline model using pre-trainedword embeddings, <br />
   and the second will be a more sophisticated version using an LSTM! ðŸ¤© ðŸ’« ðŸ”¥
